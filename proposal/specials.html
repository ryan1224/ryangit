  <p id="girl-text">This is the girl that I fell deeply in love with. From the moment I saw her, I knew that there was something undeniably special about this girl.
  Funny enough that she was the entire reason we even started dating in the first place. I was too chicken to text her, so she decided to do it herself.
  Thank God she did, because that one text spawned a beautiful friendship and an unwavering love.
  I know it’s weird to say, but I knew the exact moment that I fell in love with her. It was such a simple night. We were hanging out at her apartment, watching tv, talking, and phasing in and out of consciousness.
  At one point, I had woken up to her lying her head delicately on my shoulder. It was at that exact moment, staring at the spinning blades of her ceiling fan, that I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.
  Never in my life had I ever felt so safe, so loved, and since that moment my love for her has only grown exponentially. Every time Amber looks at me, my day becomes instantaneously better.
  Amber Boren loves me more than I ever could have thought imaginable, and I want to spend the rest of my life trying to her love her just as much as she loves me.

  <h2>So, I have a question for you</h2>
    <p id="girl-text">Remember when you said I couldn’t surprise you…yeah well you were wrong. Amber, you’re the most important thing in the world to me.
  I don’t know what I did to deserve a girl like you, but I thank God every single day for putting you in my life.
  You make me the happiest man in the world every single day and I want to spend the rest of my life loving my best friend. So…<br>
  <br id="center">Will you marry me? </p>
